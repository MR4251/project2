      <h2>Welcome to Your Fitness Journey</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to guide you through effective workouts and essential nutrition knowledge so you can achieve your goals with confidence.</p>

      <h2>Workout Split: Push, Pull, Legs</h2>
      <p>The Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) workout split is a simple and effective way to train all major muscle groups while allowing enough time for recovery. Here's how it works:</p>
    
      <h3>Push Day</h3>
      <p>Focuses on the muscles involved in pushing movements. You'll target your chest, shoulders, and triceps with exercises like bench press, overhead press, and tricep dips. Prioritize explosive strength by pushing the weight up quickly (concentric phase) and slowing down during the lowering phase (eccentric). Focus on maintaining time under tension during the eccentric to fully challenge the muscles and stimulate growth.</p>
    
      <h3>Pull Day</h3>
      <p>Targets the muscles used for pulling motions. You'll strengthen your back and biceps with exercises like pull-ups, rows, and bicep curls. Pull the weight with maximum effort, then lower it slowly and under control to maximize time under tension and muscle engagement.</p>
    
      <h3>Leg Day</h3>
      <p>Dedicated to building lower body strength and stability. Exercises like squats, deadlifts, lunges, and calf raises will develop your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Explode upward during the lift, but focus on a slow and controlled eccentric phase to increase time under tension and boost muscle activation.</p>
    
      <p>For best results, train each set close to muscular failure — meaning you should be only 1–2 reps away from being unable to complete another repetition with good form. Combining explosive concentric movements with slow, controlled eccentrics and emphasizing time under tension maximizes strength, hypertrophy, and overall workout efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Rest & Recovery</h2>
      <p>Training hard is important, but real progress happens during recovery. Rest gives your muscles time to repair, rebuild, and grow stronger. Without proper recovery, you risk overtraining, burnout, and injury — and you won't get the results you're working for.</p>
    
      <h3>How the PPL Split Supports Recovery</h3>
      <p>The Push, Pull, Legs split is designed to give each muscle group about 48 hours of rest before being trained again. For example, after training your chest, shoulders, and triceps on Push Day, you won’t train them again until after Pull and Leg Days. This built-in structure allows muscles to recover and grow while keeping your overall training frequency high.</p>
    
      <h3>Rest Days</h3>
      <p>Even with a smart split like PPL, full rest days are still essential. Plan for 1–2 complete rest days per week depending on how intense your training is. Active recovery like stretching, light cardio, or yoga can help promote blood flow without adding stress to your muscles.</p>
    
      <h3>Sleep</h3>
      <p>Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep every night. Sleep is where most of your physical recovery happens — it's critical for muscle repair, hormone balance, and mental focus. Prioritize sleep just like you prioritize your workouts.</p>
    
      <h3>Hydration and Nutrition</h3>
      <p>Recover faster by staying hydrated and fueling your body with enough protein, carbs, and healthy fats. Proper nutrition supports muscle repair and keeps your energy levels steady for your next session.</p>
    
      <p>Recovery isn't a break from your fitness journey — it's an essential part of it. Take your rest as seriously as your workouts, and your progress will skyrocket.</p>

      <h2>Diet</h2>
      <p>Training is important, but your diet plays just as big of a role in achieving your fitness goals. Understanding and managing your calorie intake is key to building muscle, losing fat, or even doing both at the same time.</p>
    
      <h3>Tracking Calories</h3>
      <p>Tracking what you eat helps you stay consistent and understand how much energy (calories) you're taking in. Apps like MyFitnessPal or MyNetDiary make it easy to log your food and see your daily totals. It's not about being perfect — it's about being aware.</p>
    
      <h3>Calories In vs. Calories Out</h3>
      <p>At the end of the day, fat loss or weight gain comes down to how much you eat, not what you eat. You can technically lose weight eating nothing but junk food like ice cream or fast food — as long as you stay in a caloric deficit. However, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Eating mostly processed foods can leave you feeling tired, hungry, and lacking key nutrients your body needs to perform and recover.</p>
    
      <h3>Caloric Deficit</h3>
      <p>To lose fat, you need to be in a caloric deficit — meaning you consume fewer calories than your body burns. A moderate deficit (around 250–500 calories less per day) is ideal for steady, sustainable fat loss while keeping your energy levels high. Even in a deficit, prioritizing protein is crucial to maintain muscle while losing fat.</p>
    
      <h3>Caloric Surplus</h3>
      <p>To gain muscle mass, you need a caloric surplus — eating slightly more calories than your body burns. Aim for a small surplus (about 250–500 calories more per day) to build muscle while minimizing fat gain. In a surplus, protein still needs to be a top priority to maximize lean muscle growth, not just weight gain.</p>
    
      <h3>Body Recomposition</h3>
      <p>Body recomposition means losing fat and building muscle at the same time. It's most effective for beginners or those returning after a break. To recomposition successfully, focus on eating around maintenance calories, training hard with progressive overload, and maintaining a high protein intake to support muscle growth while losing fat.</p>
    
      <h3>The Importance of Protein</h3>
      <p>Protein is essential for repairing and building muscle. A good general guideline is to eat around 0.8 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for about 120–150 grams of protein daily. Regardless of whether you're in a deficit, at maintenance, or in a surplus, consistently prioritizing protein is key to preserving muscle and maximizing your results. Protein also helps keep you feeling full and supports overall recovery and performance.</p>
    
      <p>Diet isn't about extreme restrictions — it's about fueling your body with the right amounts based on your goals. Stay consistent, prioritize high-quality foods when you can, and remember: small changes over time lead to big results.</p>
